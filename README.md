# Sudoku Puzzle Solver

Solves sudoku puzzles!

## Installation

Download the source code and compile with `g++`.  Included `Makefile`.  Here I'm using C++17, but you could just as well compile with C++11 (just swap `-std=c++17` for `-std=c++11`).

## Usage

To enter a (solvable) puzzle, replace the sample puzzle in src/input with the to-be-solved
puzzle, using the format as shown (0 in place of empty squares).  Compile and run the 
created executable.
